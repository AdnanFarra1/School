<p>A vital part of teaching history about the Zoo is enabling pupils to have an understanding beyond the simple facts and figures, of the historical events,
     people and places that shaped where and who we are today. Boasting a diverse and highly skilled Education Team, we provide unique learning sessions for all ages and abilities.
      Linked to the National Curriculum, we aim to deliver interactive experiences using resources such as live animals, biofacts and multimedia.</p>
      <h3>For the Pupils:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Pupils will each be given their very own wildlife sketchbook. They’ll then get the chance to learn how some great South African wildlife and animal artists use sketching and recording wildlife to help scientists understand the animals.
               Pupils will learn how to classify animals into different groups (mammals, birds, etc.) and what key features to include when sketching or recording details from each group.
               Pupils will then get the chance to get hands-on and examine animal artefacts (skulls, furs, etc.) up close and practice their techniques. 
            </li>

            <li>Animals live everywhere in the world, how do they live in such diverse habitats? Students will learn habitat characteristics, and discover some of the cool adaptions that let animals live there.</li>
            <li>Pupils investigate how different animals grow and develop. A variety of hands-on activities bring this topic to life as pupils examine replica eggs and play games to explore the various life stages of different organisms.</li>
            <li>Pupils will get hands-on working in small groups to practice maths skills in a fun, interactive way. Groups rotate around different activities that often involve real animal artefacts, or even live animals. Activities are tailored
                 depending on age and may include: comparing patterns on tortoise shells, measuring snake skins, solving calculations involving enclosure size, timing animals’ speed over a defined distance, and more!</li>
      </ul>
